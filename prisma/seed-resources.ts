      content: `# Introduction to Algebra - Basic Concepts

## What is Algebra?
Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses symbols and letters to represent numbers and quantities in formulas and equations.

## Key Concepts

### Variables
Variables are symbols (usually letters) that represent unknown numbers.
- Example: In the equation x + 5 = 10, x is a variable

### Constants
Constants are fixed values that don't change.
- Example: In the equation x + 5 = 10, 5 and 10 are constants

### Expressions
An algebraic expression is a combination of variables, constants, and operations.
- Example: 3x + 2y - 7

### Equations
An equation is a statement that two expressions are equal.
- Example: 2x + 3 = 11

## Basic Operations

### Addition and Subtraction
- 3x + 2x = 5x
- 7y - 4y = 3y

### Multiplication
- 3 × 2x = 6x
- 4 × (x + 2) = 4x + 8

### Division
- 6x ÷ 2 = 3x
- (8x + 4) ÷ 4 = 2x + 1

## Practice Problems
1. Simplify: 3x + 2x + 5
2. Solve: x + 7 = 15
3. Evaluate: 2x + 3 when x = 4

## Summary
Algebra helps us solve problems with unknown quantities using variables and equations.`,

      title: 'Photosynthesis Process - Complete Guide',
      content: `# Photosynthesis Process - Complete Guide

## What is Photosynthesis?
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy, producing glucose and oxygen.

## The Process

### Light-Dependent Reactions
1. **Light Absorption**: Chlorophyll absorbs light energy
2. **Water Splitting**: Water molecules are split into hydrogen and oxygen
3. **ATP Formation**: Energy is stored in ATP molecules
4. **NADPH Formation**: Hydrogen combines with NADP+ to form NADPH

### Light-Independent Reactions (Calvin Cycle)
1. **Carbon Fixation**: CO₂ is captured and combined with RuBP
2. **Reduction**: ATP and NADPH provide energy to form glucose
3. **Regeneration**: RuBP is regenerated to continue the cycle

## Chemical Equation
6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂

## Factors Affecting Photosynthesis

### Light Intensity
- More light = faster photosynthesis (up to a point)
- Too much light can damage chlorophyll

### Carbon Dioxide Concentration
- Higher CO₂ levels increase photosynthesis rate
- Important for greenhouse farming

### Temperature
- Optimal temperature: 20-30°C
- Too hot or too cold slows down the process

### Water Availability
- Essential for the light-dependent reactions
- Water stress reduces photosynthesis

## Importance of Photosynthesis
- Produces oxygen for respiration
- Forms the base of most food chains
- Removes CO₂ from the atmosphere
- Provides energy for life on Earth

## Practice Questions
1. What are the two main stages of photosynthesis?
2. Write the chemical equation for photosynthesis
3. How does light intensity affect photosynthesis?
4. Why is photosynthesis important for life on Earth?`,
