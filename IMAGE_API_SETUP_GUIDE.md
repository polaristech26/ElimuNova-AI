```env
# Use Replicate (most affordable)
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN="your-replicate-token"
```

### Budget: Medium ($20-50/month)
```env
# Use Stability AI Professional
STABILITY_API_KEY="your-stability-key"
# Backup with Replicate
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN="your-replicate-token"
```

### Budget: High Quality Needed
```env
# Use OpenAI DALL-E for best quality
OPENAI_DALLE_API_KEY="your-openai-key"

## Complete .env Configuration

After getting your API keys, your .env should look like:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/edugenius_ai?schema=public"

# Authentication
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="edugenius-ai-secret-key-2024"

# AI Text Generation (OpenRouter)
OPENAI_API_KEY="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"

# Image Generation APIs (Choose at least one)
OPENAI_DALLE_API_KEY="sk-proj-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
STABILITY_API_KEY="sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN="r8_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

---

## Testing Your Setup

### Test Script
Create a test file to verify your API keys work:

```bash
# Run the image generation test
npm run test:image-api
```

Or manually test in the app:
1. Go to Teacher Dashboard
2. Click "AI Tools"
3. Try "Image Generator"
4. Enter a prompt: "A colorful diagram of the solar system"
5. Click "Generate Image"

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit .env files**
   - Already in .gitignore
   - Double-check before pushing code

2. **Use environment variables in production**
   - Set them in your hosting platform (Vercel, Railway, etc.)
   - Don't hardcode API keys

3. **Rotate keys regularly**
   - Change keys every 3-6 months
   - Immediately rotate if exposed

4. **Set usage limits**
   - Configure spending limits in each platform
   - Monitor usage regularly

5. **Use separate keys for dev/production**
   - Different keys for testing vs production
   - Easier to track and manage

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API Key" Error
- Check if key is copied correctly (no extra spaces)
- Verify key hasn't expired
- Ensure billing is set up (for paid APIs)

### "Quota Exceeded" Error
- Check your usage limits
- Add more credits or upgrade plan
- Wait for quota reset (usually monthly)

### "Rate Limit" Error
- Too many requests too quickly
- Add delays between requests
- Upgrade to higher tier plan

### Images Not Generating
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify API key is in .env
- Restart development server after adding keys
- Check API service status pages

## Cost Optimization Tips

1. **Cache Generated Images**
   - Save images to avoid regenerating
   - Store in database or cloud storage

2. **Use Lower Resolution for Previews**
   - Generate smaller images first
   - Only create high-res when needed

3. **Batch Requests**
   - Generate multiple images at once
   - Some APIs offer batch discounts

4. **Choose Right Provider**
   - DALL-E: Best quality, highest cost
   - Stability AI: Good balance
   - Replicate: Most affordable

5. **Monitor Usage**
   - Set up alerts for spending
   - Review usage weekly
   - Adjust limits as needed

---

## Next Steps

1. Choose your preferred API provider(s)
2. Sign up and get API key(s)
3. Add keys to .env file
4. Restart your development server
5. Test image generation in the app
6. Set up usage monitoring
7. Configure production environment variables
